# Image-Domain-Filters
Uses most of the Domain filters (spatial &amp; Frequency). 

## Filter authors
For the Spatial Domain filters:
  • Smoothing Spatial filters (used for noise reduction):
    o Median filter. Hoss
    o Adaptive filter (median, min, or max). Hoss
    o Averaging filter. Hoss
    o Gaussian filter. Bodra
  • Sharpening Spatial filters:
    o Laplacian Operator. NOT DONE
    o Unsharp Masking and Highboost Filtering. NOT DONE
    o Roberts Cross-Gradient Operators. NOT DONE
    o Sobel Operators. Bodra
• Noise filters:
    o Impulse noise (salt and pepper). Steven
    o Gaussian noise. Bodra
    o Uniform noise. Bodra
For the Transform /Frequency Domain filters:
    • Histogram Equalization. Mina
    • Histogram Specification. Steven
